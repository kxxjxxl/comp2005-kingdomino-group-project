# comp2005-kingdomino-group-project
This is a group project me and my other 4 colleagues worked on. The game is coded in Java and we had 4 iteration to work and improve the game upon. 

We build the game from scratch, focusing on documentation and planning on iteration 1 through 4 all while bringing the ideas to life. 
Screenshots and video demo are avalible in the 4th iteration.
