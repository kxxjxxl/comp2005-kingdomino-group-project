# comp2005-kingdomino-group-project
This is a group project me and my other 4 colleagues worked on. The game is coded in Java and we had 4 iteration to work and improve the game upon. 

We build the game from scratch, focusing on documentation and planning on iteration 1 through 4 all while bringing the ideas to life with 
object oriented programming in Java. 
Screenshots and video demo are avalible in the 4th iteration. The test cases written in JUnit is also avalible in the 4th Iteration.

## Technologies used through out the 4 months project:

- Java (duh)
- JUnit
- Jira (For tracking project bugs and improvements)
- Github (duh again)
